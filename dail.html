					In July 2017, I, along with a group of senior students from the Corish-Wallace Performing Arts School in Wexford travelled up to <i lang="ga">Dáil Éireann</i> to perform a manifesto piece based upon mental health in Ireland.

				<h2>A Bit of Background</h2>
				<p>
					For our Christmas show in 2016, we decided to take a detour from our scripted show that we usually perform before we break for Christmas. We instead performed a manifesto piece (a performance to convey a message) based on a topic very close to all of our hearts - mental health. My drama teachers, Carmel and Lauren Corish-Wallace, saw this as an opportunity to send the message as far as they could. They invited along a number of people of influence from around Wexford, including a local councillor. The performance eventually made its way to Wexford-born <i lang="ga">Fianna Fáil</i> TD James Browne. James, a strong advocate of mental health support, subsequently organised for us to perform the same piece in the <i lang="ga">Dáil</i>.

				<h2>The Day in Question</h2>
				<p>
					After weeks of rehearsal to perfect and develop our performance further, the day arrived for us to finally show of what we had created. We left Wexford at about 8 in the morning full of excitement and nerves. We arrived in Dublin and had some time to spare. We decided to rehearse the performance one last time at a corner of St. Stephen's Green. As we were rehearsing, a sizeable audience built up to see what we were doing. This got us in the mindset for the actual performance. After the rehearsal, we headed into the <i lang="ga">Dáil</i>. We were brought to meet James and shown the room we would be performing in. Finally the moment of truth arrived. As we nervously waited in the corner, the room started to fill. We had everyone from TDs to senators to counillors to ordinary staff working within Leinster House who had come to see. We performed the piece and smashed it. By the end there were tears, but it was worth it. We then had a sort of Q&amp;A/Discussion with the audience. We heard powerful stories of family members who had taken their own life, and people who the audience members had worked with who were in need of help. Each story highlighted the struggle of mental health in Ireland today.
