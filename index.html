					Hello and welcome to my website. My name is Conor Heeney and I created this site to look back on the hobbies that have shaped who I am and the experiences I have gained from them. Enjoy!

				<h2>A little Introduction</h2>
				<p> 
					My name is Conor Heeney and I was born on the 24th August in the year 1999. I am 19 years old and was born in the quaint little town of Wexford, Co. Wexford in the South East of Ireland. I am currently a first year student in University College Cork, studying computer science. I previously attended Kennedy Park Primary School and St. Peters College Secondary School in Wexford. I studied 8 subjects: English, Irish, Maths, Physics, Business, Applied Maths, French and Music.

				<h2>The Leaving Cert</h2>
				<p>
					As I am in first year of University, I obviously completed the Leaving Cert (Just about). It was a stressful year full of tears, anxiety and sleepless nights, but I got through it and reached my dream of studying computer science in university. I recieved 477 points in my Leaving, which was well above what I needed for my course. Here's a summary of my results:

				<h2>My Hobbies</h2>
				<p>
					I'm not a very sporty person. The only 2 sports I do are cycling and rowing. My two favourite hobbies, however, are music and drama. I started off at the young age of 6, when I began playing the violin in the County Wexford School of Music. It was very clear from early on that I would be more involved with the arts rather than sports. When I turned 7, I started in my local drama group: The Corish Wallace Performing Arts School. I didn't exactly fit in back in primary school, but these two hobbies let me be myself. Since then, I have travelled to Italy to play music, acted in front of TDs and senators in the Dail, and I am now a part of one of the biggest amature orchestras in the country; Wexford Sinfonia.

				<p>
				My mother's name is Mairead, who was born in Wexford and my father's name is Jimmy, who was born and raised in Co. Westmeath, just outside Mullingar. I have 3 sisters - Fiona, Niamh and Aisling. I have 4 nephews and a niece - Fiona's children, Adam (9), Dylan (4) and Cillian (1) and Niamh's children, Caoimhe (4), Liam (2). I'm the youngest of my siblings, and I'm the only boy, so I'm obviously the best.
