				<p>
					In the Summer of 2016, I, along with the County Wexford Youth Orchestra, travelled to the town of San Salvo in Italy. There we took part in a festival called Music Inclusion. This is a festival where a number of music groups from around the world come and play music from their native country and then join for one mega-orchestra and play some well-known pieces. Along with us, there was an orchestra from Italy, Spain and Slovakia. This remains to be one of the most amazing things I have ever done in my life and it will be something I'm proud of for years to come.

				<h2>What Did We Get Up To?</h2>
				<p>
					We went to Italy on the evening of 8th July 2016. We arrived on the morning of the 9th. Rehearsals didn't start until the next day, so we decided to make use of the day and headed to the beach. We made the most of that day because the rest of the holiday was going to be full with rehearsals. We had five days of 8-hour long rehearsals (with breaks obviously) and in the evenings, each individual orchestra had their own concert. Our concert took place on the 12th July. We played a number of Irish trad tunes, including Molly on the Shore and Pachabel's Frolics and I gCuimhne, which was composed by one of the music teachers in my former secondary school. We also had performances of Irish dancing. The whole orchestra gave a performance of mumming (a traditional Irish group dance, similar to a céilí) 
				</p>
				<p>
					On the evenings of the last 2 days, the four orchestras came together to perform a reportoire of popular film music. These included the soundtrack from Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Lord of the Rings, and West Side Story. Seeing these performances was a truly amaxing sight. It wasn't hard to see just how well the power of music can bring people of all nationalities, cultures and ethnicities together.

				<h2>The Effect This Trip Had on Me</h2>
				<p>
					My time in San Salvo had such an amazing effect on my life. Not only did I develop myself as a musician, but I got to experience new styles of music that I would never have experienced before, I made new friends that I'm still in touch with today, and I experienced what life is like for those musicians who often travel abroad for festivals. I truly was very lucky to have been offered the opportunity.
